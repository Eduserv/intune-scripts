# intune-scripts

This repo contains some public shared scripts for intune.

## [deploy-winget-app](./deploy-winget-app.ps1) 
An adapted version of [@andrew-s-taylor's](https://github.com/andrew-s-taylor/public) script but uses [Microsoft Graph PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/?view=graph-powershell-1.0) instead of the AzureAD PowerShell module.  I've also implemented a few additional fixes which can be seen in the commits.

Other scripts to come
